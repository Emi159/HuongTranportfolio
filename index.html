												<h3>Streaming Data Analytics</h3>
												<p>In my recent project, I analyzed global wheat-trading datasets recorded daily, leveraging streaming data analytics to track vessel movements and back corrections in real time. My curiosity in streaming data analytics has deepened, especially after attending the webinar "How Live Commodity Data Adds Value," presented by the AXSMarine. This webinar illuminated how live shipping and commodity data enable swift, fact-based assessments and the use of indicators to support decision-making.</p>

												<h3>Time Series Analysis</h3>
												<p>One of my favorite courses during my master's program was "The Statistical Analysis of Time Series," taught by my thesis supervisor, Professor Davide La Vecchia. In this course, we explored various methods for trend and seasonal decomposition, using techniques such as moving averages and exponential smoothing to detect patterns. We also employed statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to identify trends and seasonality. This course provided a solid foundation for my thesis and deepened my understanding of time series analysis.

												<h3>Statisical Inference</h3>
												<p>"The correlation of two variables does not show the direction of impact." My primary domain of interest lies in Statistical Inference, where I focus on drawing reliable conclusions from data through rigorous analysis and methodology. Throughout my academic journey, I have delved into various aspects of statistical inference, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and estimation techniques. My experience with large datasets and complex analyses underscores my commitment to utilizing statistical inference to derive actionable insights and inform decision-making in various applications.</p>

												<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
												<p>  I have experience manipulating large datasets and applying

													rank in a Kaggle competition in modeling and predicting income level based on demographic predictors, attest to my 
													strong problem-solving skills and ability to design and implement sophisticated machine-learning models for real-world 
													applications. My other projects, namely the Stock Price Prediction, and Product Review Analysis, have equipped me 
													with the expertise to apply state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to extract 
													valuable insights from large datasets. Moreover, my master's thesis, titled "A study about the power of Giacomini-White 
													test in forecast evaluation, with an application to financial data," reflects my genuine interest in machine learning and 
													time series analysis.  </p>

											<h3>Real time data analysis</h3>
											<p>This project aims to leverage real-time datasets to monitor which trading countries and ports made the most back corrections, as well as the magnitude and direction of these adjustments in real time. The project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools, including Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Python, SQL and Power BI, to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize the data.</p>

											<h3>Product reviews analysis</h3>
											<p>This project was implemented in collaboration with Effixis, a data science company specializing in NLP solutions. A large dataset of customer reviews is composed of textual customer reviews for given products and additional information such as product categories. Each review is accompanied by a customer rating of product satisfaction. This project utilizes various technologies, including Python and Natural Language Processing algorithms such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and pre-trained models, for sentiment analysis and machine learning.</p>

											<h3>A study about the power of
												Giacomini-White test in forecast
												evaluation, with an application to
												financial data</h3>
										
											<p>Forecasting is crucial in statistics and machine learning, enabling accurate predictions and informed decision-making based on historical data patterns. Evaluating forecasting methods involves two key approaches: point and interval forecasting. Point forecasts are assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics are also common in machine learning model evaluations, with lower scores typically indicating better performance. However, a lower metric score does not always guarantee a better model for the entire population.  In this paper, I am going to focus on the use of the Giacomini-White (GW) test in comparing predictive ability between two competing forecasting models. This project combines time series analysis and advanced machine learning, utilizing forecasting evaluation, Python, R, statistical tests, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Sequential Learning Models.</p>

											<h3>Income Prediction</h3>
											<p>I achieved 1st rank in a Kaggle competition using data from the US Census Bureau, analyzing US residents who participated in the 2020-2021 survey. The goal was to predict income levels (high or low) based on demographic predictors. This forecasting task utilized ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost, and meta models. The final submission was a hard-max-vote ensemble. However, we recognized the methodological importance of using rigorous methods like cross-validation and noted that predictions from XGBoost, LGBM, or CatBoost, which had been cross-validated, would be more methodologically sound. However, we think that the voting ensemble is at least as strong as the individual learners that contribute to it. </p>
